FIRST HOUR
-- completed the foundation and the direction i want the app towards 
-- backend just got the mongoDB connected and the different routes i want the app to take when it comes to middleware 
-- next hour i will be focusing on the frontend to hopefully finish the general 'look' of the site
-- still some bugs here and there but they are mainly from me setting up my files first just to give myself an idea of what i want to do
