Message to Joe - You were not joking when you told me i need to basically learn how to become a fullstack eng/dev in less than a month (I did it in a week because of midterms though)! Haha

FIRST HOUR
-- completed the foundation and the direction i want the app towards 
-- backend just got the mongoDB connected and the different routes i want the app to take when it comes to middleware 
-- next hour i will be focusing on the frontend to hopefully finish the general 'look' of the site
-- still some bugs here and there but they are mainly from me setting up my files first just to give myself an idea of what i want to do 


SECOND HOUR 
-- completed more of the components from the front end 
-- missing the data and i dont want to waste time with dummy data 
-- so im going to work on the back end and try to finish the logic part of fetching 


THIRD HOUR 
-- just worked on the logic for the mytools-controller
-- i have been using postman to test sending request to my backend server to make sure everything checks out 
-- next i am going to finish the tools-controller and that should be quick cause the logic is similar to the mytools-controller 
-- and finish up final touches on the front end before i can finish by putting in my fetch() in the frontend and make sure it works properly 


FOURTH HOUR 
-- finished up the backend and it works fine after double checking with postman for the send the requests 
-- finished up the front end of fetching the tools to put on displays 
-- all i need to do is finsih up the checkout and checkin buttons and make it possible to view each tool indiviually 
-- trying to fix button to disable and able buttons depending on if a tool is checkout or not 


FIFTH HOUR 
-- got everything in place EXCEPT the OneToolItem.js file becasue i was planning on using it to display an individal tool but that didnt go as planned because i couldnt figure out how to take the respponse data back from fetch() in the Tool.js page 
-- the check in and out buttons work in a sense that they add and remove from users tools DB but the disabled method for each buttons works when user clicks on a button first. i would of liked the checkin button to be disabled to begin with. also buttons reset when switching from one page to another which is not what i planned. 



INFORMATION ABOUT THE DATABASE: 
-- i used mongoose which works well with mongoDB, makes things easier 
-- i manually added the tools, i dont know how to give you (Nur or Joe or whoever is looking at this code) access to my account to add in more tools
-- but obvi you can see that its stored in a mongoDB because im not using any dummer variables in my code to store any data

I like to make multiple folders and files to "outsource" some logic or code both in the backend and frontend. It just makes things alot easier for me to stay organized.

I am not sure if there is anything else worth mentioning so if you have any questions or anything obviously feel free to reach out.
