FIRST HOUR
-- completed the foundation and the direction i want the app towards 
-- backend just got the mongoDB connected and the different routes i want the app to take when it comes to middleware 
-- next hour i will be focusing on the frontend to hopefully finish the general 'look' of the site
-- still some bugs here and there but they are mainly from me setting up my files first just to give myself an idea of what i want to do 


SECOND HOUR 
-- completed more of the components from the front end 
-- missing the data and i dont want to waste time with dummy data 
-- so im going to work on the back end and try to finish the logic part of fetching 


THIRD HOUR 
-- just worked on the logic for the mytools-controller
-- i have been using postman to test sending request to my backend server to make sure everything checks out 
-- next i am going to finish the tools-controller and that should be quick cause the logic is similar to the mytools-controller 
-- and finish up final touches on the front end before i can finish by putting in my fetch() in the frontend and make sure it works properly 


FOURTH HOUR 
-- finished up the backend and it works fine after double checking with postman for the send the requests 
-- finished up the front end of fetching the tools to put on displays 
-- all i need to do is finsih up the checkout and checkin buttons and make it possible to view each tool indiviually 
-- trying to fix button to disable and able buttons depending on if a tool is checkout or not
